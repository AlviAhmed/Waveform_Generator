* Designing a waveform generator according to a set of specifications 

** SPECIFICATIONS:

*** Waveform Functions:

    -Triangular or Square wave output (User Selectable)

*** Frequency Range:

    -Range #1 ≈ 100 Hz to 1800 Hz 
    -Range #2 ≈ 20 Hz to 360 Hz    

Both ranges user selectable

*** Input Voltage Control Range:

    -0.1V to 5V   

*** Output Amplitude Control Range:

-0V to 8V pk-pk  

Building and Designing was a steady process from the basics to the final product, which can be seen in this repository.
